# vagrant-files
This project is a collection of Vagrant configuration and supporting files for running various server applications using vagrant.

The idea is to have a set of vagrant configuration files for various databases, web servers, message brokers, etc so you don't need to 
have them installed on you computer all the time.  You can use vagrant to fire up a virtual machine for running the application
and then throw it away when your done.
